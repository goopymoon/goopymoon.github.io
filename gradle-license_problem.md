If android-sdk-windows has folder of same name (such as android-sdk-windows/android-sdk-windows) gradle suffers from android license problem.
If you accept Edit/Project settings.../Platforms/Android/Acceopt SDK License android-sdk-windows/licenses/android-sdk-license file is generated. The file contains following hash value.
